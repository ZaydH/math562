\begin{problem}
  \probNum{5.4.5} Suppose $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$ is a random sample of size~$n$ drawn from a Poisson pdf where $\lambda$ is an unknown parameter. Show that ${\hat{\lambda} = X}$ is unbiased for~$\lambda$. For what type of parameter, in general, will the sample mean necessarily be an unbiased estimator? (Hint: The answer is implicit in the derivation showing that $X$ is unbiased for the Poisson~$\lambda$.)
