\begin{problem}
  \probNum{5.3.4} A physician who has a group of thirty-eight female patients aged 18 to 24 on a special diet wishes to estimate the effect of the diet on total serum cholesterol. For this group, their average serum cholesterol is 188.4 (measured in mg/100mL). Because of a large-scale government study, the physician is willing to assume that the total serum cholesterol measurements are normally distributed with standard deviation of ${\sigma = 40.7}$. Find a 95\%~confidence interval of the mean serum cholesterol of patients on the special diet. Does the diet seem to have any effect on their serum cholesterol, given that the national average for women aged 18 to 24 is 192.0?
\end{problem}

The 95\%~confidence interval is ${\bar{x} \pm 1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$.  Substituting in this problem's values, we get:

\begin{equation*}
  188.4 \pm 1.96 \frac{40.7}{\sqrt{38}} = 188.4 \pm 12.9 \text{.}
\end{equation*}

The upper bound is therefore~201.3 so this diet does not seem to have an effect.
