\begin{problem}
  \probNum{5.3.13} The Pew Research Center did a survey of 2,253~adults and discovered that 63\%~of them had broadband Internet connections in their homes. The survey report noted that this figure represented a ``significant jump'' from the similar figure of 54\%~from two years earlier. One way to define ``significant jump'' is to show that the earlier number does not lie in the 95\%~confidence interval. Was the increase significant by this definition?
\end{problem}

The Bernoulli variance equals ${p(1-p)}$.  Using the sample proportion we see that for this problem, the estimated standard deviation is~0.48.  Consider the sample size and the confidence level, the confidence interval's width is ${\pm1.99\%}$.  Since the difference in proportion equals~0.09, the change is significant.
