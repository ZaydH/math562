\begin{problem}
  \probNum{5.4.3} Five hundred adults are asked whether they favor a bipartisan campaign finance reform bill. If the true proportion of the electorate is 52\%~in favor of the legislation, what are the chances that fewer than half of those in the sample support the proposal? Use a $Z$~transformation to approximate the answer.
\end{problem}

Given ${p=0.52}$, the standard deviation can be estimated as ${\sqrt{0.52 \cdot 0.48} \approx 0.50}$.  Normalizing for sample size yields a confidence width of ${\pm z * \frac{0.5}{\sqrt{500}} \approx \pm 0.023}$.  For a 2\%~shift, ${z=-0.894}$.  Linearly interpolating from the $Z$\-/transformation table, the chances the sample is less than~50\% is approximately~$\boxed{0.1851}$.
