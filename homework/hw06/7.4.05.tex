\begin{problem}
  \probNum{7.4.5}~Suppose a random sample of size~${n=11}$ is drawn from a normal distribution with ${\mu = 15.0}$.  For what value of~$k$ is the following true?
  \begin{equation}
    \Pr\sbrack{\abs{\frac{\bar{Y} - 15.0}{S/\sqrt{11}}} \geq k} = 0.05
  \end{equation}
\end{problem}

The degrees of freedom is~${n - 1 = 10}$. ${k = 2.2281}$
