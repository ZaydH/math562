\begin{problem}
  \probNum{6.5.6}~Suppose a sufficient statistic exists for the parameter~$\theta$. Use Theorem~5.6.1 to show that the critical region of a likelihood ratio test will depend on the sufficient statistic.
\end{problem}

By Theorem~5.6.1, the likelihood can be decomposed into the product of two functions namely:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $g$, which is a function of the sufficient statistic and $\theta$
  \item $b$, which is exclusively a function of the sample data.
\end{enumerate}
Since~$b$ and~$\theta$ are unrelated, the~$\theta$ maximizing~$\g$ is solely based on the sufficient statistic.  Therefore, the GLR value,~$\lambda$ which is a ratio of likelihoods must also be a function of the sufficient statistic.
