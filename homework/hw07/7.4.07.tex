\begin{problem}
  \probNum{7.4.7}~Cell phones emit radio frequency energy that is absorbed by the body when the phone is next to the ear and may be harmful.  The table in the next column gives the absorption rate for a sample of twenty high-radio cell phones.  Construct a 90\%~confidence interval for the true average cell phone absorption rate.
\end{problem}

The number of samples is ${n=20}$ so there are 19~degrees of freedom.  The mean is~1.4255.  The sample standard deviation is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SampleStdDev}
  S = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})}{n - 1}}\text{.}
\end{equation}
\noindent
${S = 0.056}$. For~${\alpha = 0.9}$, ${t_{\alpha / 2} = 1.7291}$.

The confidence interval is ${1.4255 \pm \frac{t \cdot s}{\sqrt{n}}}$.  The final range is ${[1.404,1.447]}$.
