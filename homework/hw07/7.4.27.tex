\begin{problem}
  \probNum{7.4.27}~On which of the following datasets would you be reluctant to do a $t$\=/test?  Explain?
\end{problem}

I would be reluctant to do a $t$\=/test on~(c). The data does not appear to be normally distributed which is the assumption of a $t$\=/test.  The dataset is also small; a large dataset may even be approximately normal for large~$n$.
