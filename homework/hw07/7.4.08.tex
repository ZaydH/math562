\begin{problem}
  \probNum{7.4.8}~The following table lists the typical cost of repairing the bumper of a moderately priced midsize car damaged by a corner collision at 3~mph.  Use these observations to construct a 95\%~confidence interval for~$\mu$, the true average repair cost for all such automobiles with similar damage.  The sample standard deviation for these data is ${s = \$369.02}$.
\end{problem}

${n = 16}$. A confidence interval is two sided; with ${\alpha = 0.95}$, ${t_{0.025,15} = 2.131}$.  The sample mean is ${\bar{\mu} = 1516}$.

Therefore, the confidence interval is:
\begin{align}
  \bar{\mu} \pm \frac{T \cdot s}{\sqrt{n}} &= 1516 \pm \frac{2.131 \cdot 369.02}{\sqrt{16}} \\
                                           &= 1516 \pm 196.6 \text{.}
\end{align}

The range is therefore: $\sbrack{1319.4,1712.6}$.
