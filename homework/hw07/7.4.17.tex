\begin{problem}
  \probNum{7.4.17}~Recall the \textit{Bacillus subtilis} data in Question~5.3.2.  Test the null hypothesis that exposure to the enzyme does not affect a worker's respiratory capacity (as measured by the FEV\textsubscript{1}/VC ration).  Use a one side $H_1$ and let ${\alpha = 0.05}$.  Assume that $\sigma$~is not known.
\end{problem}

Using the data on page~306, ${\bar{y} = 0.766}$.  Also, ${s = 0.0859}$.  ${n = 19}$.  ${T_{0.05,18} = 1.7341}$.

The null hypothesis is rejected if
\begin{equation}
  0.766 = \bar{y} < 0.8 - \frac{1.7341 \cdot 0.0859}{\sqrt{19}} = 0.800 - 0.0342 = 0.7658 \text{.}
\end{equation}
There is \textbf{not} rejected.
