\begin{problem}
  (\textnormal{Problem~5.2.7}) An engineer is creating a project schedule program and recognizes that the tasks making up the project are not always completed on time.  However, the completion proportion tends to be fairly high.  To reflect this condition, he uses the pdf

  \begin{equation}\label{eq:P04}
    f_{Y}(y;\theta)=\theta y^{\theta - 1}, \hspace{0.1cm} 0 \leq y \leq 1, \hspace{0.1cm} 0 < \theta
  \end{equation}

  \noindent
  where $y$~is the proportion of the task completed.  Suppose that in his previous project, the proportions of tasks completed were~0.77, 0.82, 0.92, 0.94, and~0.98.  Estimate~$\theta$.
\end{problem}

For a set of~$n$ proportions, the likelihood is

\begin{equation}\label{eq:P04:Likelihood}
  L_{n}(\theta) = \theta^{n} \prod_{i=1}^{n} y_{i}^{\theta - 1} \text{.}
\end{equation}

\noindent
The log likelihood is

\begin{equation}\label{eq:P04:LogLikelihood}
  \ell_{n}(\theta) = n\ln(\theta) + (\theta - 1) \sum_{i=1}^{n} \ln y_i \text{.}
\end{equation}

\noindent
The log likelihood's derivative is:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:P04:LogLikelihood:Deriv}
  \ell_{n}'(\theta) = \frac{n}{\theta} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \ln y_i \text{.}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Setting this to zero yields

\begin{align}
  \frac{n}{\theta} &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \ln\left(\frac{1}{y_i} \right) \\
  \theta &= \frac{n}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 / y_i} \\
         &\approx \boxed{7.996} \text{.}
\end{align}
