\begin{problem}
  \probNum{5.8.2} Find the squared loss ${\sbrack{L(\hat{\theta},\theta) = \left(\hat{\theta} - \theta\right)^2}}$ Bayes estimate for the~$\theta$ in Example~5.8.2 and express it as a weighted average of the maximum likelihood estimate for~$\theta$ and the mean of the prior pdf.
\end{problem}

The squared loss Bayes estimate for~$\theta$ is the mean of the penultimate equation on page~333.  This is found from the Beta Distribution with~${r = k + 4}$ and~${s = n - k + 102}$.  Therefore, the mean is~$\frac{k+4}{n+106}$.

\noindent
It is easy to show that the MLE of the Binomial Distribution is~${\frac{k}{n}}$.

\noindent
The mean of the prior is from the Beta Distribution with~${r=4}$ and ${s=102}$ making it~${\frac{4}{106}}$.

\noindent
Specifying it as the weighted sum as required in the problem makes it:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\frac{n}{n+1}\left(\frac{k}{n}\right) + \frac{106}{n + 106} \left(\frac{4}{106}\right)}
\end{equation}
