\begin{problem}
  \probNum{5.7.01} How large a sample must be taken from a normal pdf where ${\expect{Y} = 18}$ in order to guarantee that ${\hat{\mu}_n = \bar{Y}_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i}$ has a 90\%~probability of lying somewhere in the interval~${\sbrack{16,20}}$?  Assume that ${\sigma = 5.0}$.
\end{problem}

To have 90\% confidence, each of the tails should have 5\%~of the probability mass.  Using the $Z$\=/table, this corresponds to ${Z \approx 1.645}$.

\begin{align}
  Z \approx 1.645 &= \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \\
                  &= \frac{2\sqrt{n}}{5.0} \\
                n &= \ceil{16.91} \\
                  &= \boxed{17} \text{.}
\end{align}
