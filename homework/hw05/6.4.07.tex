\begin{problem}
  \probNum{6.4.7}~If $H_0$: ${\mu = 200}$ is to be tested against $H_1$: ${\mu < 200}$ at the ${\alpha = 0.10}$~level of significance based on a random sample of size~$n$ from a normal distribution where ${\sigma = 15.0}$, what is the smallest value for~$n$ that will make the power equal to at least~0.75 when~${\mu = 197}$?
\end{problem}

If ${\alpha = 0.10}$, then~${Z = 1.28}$.  For a power of~0.75, then ${Z=0.675}$.
\begin{align*}
  \frac{200 - 1.28 *\frac{15}{\sqrt{n}} - 197}{15 / \sqrt{n}} &\geq 0.675
  3 \sqrt(n) &\geq ( 0.675 + 1.28) * 15
  n \geq 95.05 \text{.}
\end{align*}

The sample size must be a whole number larger so~$\boxed{n = 96}$.
