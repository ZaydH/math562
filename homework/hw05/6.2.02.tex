\begin{problem}
  \probNum{6.2.2}~An herbalist is experimenting with juices extracted from berries and roots that may have the ability to affect the Stanford-Binet IQ scores of students afflicted with mild cases of attention deficit disorder~(ADD).  A random sample of twenty-two children diagnosed with the condition have been drinking Berry Smart daily for two months. Past experience suggests that children with ADD~score an average of~95 on the IQ test with a standard deviation of~15. If the data are to be analyzed using the ${\alpha =0.06}$ level of significance, what values of ${\bar{y}}$~would cause ${H_0}$ to be rejected.  Assume that $H_1$ is two-sided.
\end{problem}

\noindent
${Z_{\alpha / 2} = -1.88}$. The null hypothesis of no affect is rejected when:
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\abs{\bar{y} - 95}}{15 / \sqrt{22}} \geq 1.88\text{.}
\end{equation*}

\noindent
Therefore, ${\bar{y} \leq 89.0}$ or ${\bar{y} \geq 101.0}$.
