\begin{subproblem}
  Suppose $H_0$: ${\mu = \mu_0}$ is rejected in favor of $H_1$: ${\mu = \mu_0}$ at the ${\alpha = 0.05}$~level of significance.  Would $H_0$~necessarily be rejected at the ${\alpha = 0.01}$~level of significance?
\end{subproblem}

\noindent
No.  ${\alpha = 0.01}$~is a stricter requirement so it will catch five~times less cases than ${\alpha = 0.05}$.

  Suppose $H_0$: ${\mu = \mu_0}$ is rejected in favor of $H_1$: ${\mu = \mu_0}$ at the ${\alpha = 0.01}$~level of significance.  Would $H_0$~necessarily be rejected at the ${\alpha = 0.05}$~level of significance?
\end{subproblem}

\noindent
Yes.  ${\alpha = 0.05}$~is a superset of~${\alpha = 0.01}$.
